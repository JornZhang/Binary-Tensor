Software accompaniment to:

M. Wang and L. Li. Learning from Binary Multiway Data: Probabilistic Tensor Decomposition and Its Statistical Optimality. https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05076

This is a working folder that contains R functions and examples for binary tensor decomposition. The current version is under test. An updated version will be coming soon. Keep tuned!
